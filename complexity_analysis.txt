Prim Algorithm

Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the implementation is O(V^2) where V is number of vertices.

Space complexity
The space complexity of the  implementation is  VxV size matrix array.


Kruskal Algorithm

Time Complexity:

O(ElogE) or O(ElogV).
Sorting of edges takes O(ELogE) time.
After sorting, we iterate through all edges and apply the find-union algorithm.
The find and union operations can take at most O(LogV) time.
So overall complexity is O(ELogE + ELogV) time. The value of E can be at most O(V2), so O(LogV) is O(LogE) the same.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)

Space complexity

No extra space is needed we need space to store graph in array[Vertices][Edges]
